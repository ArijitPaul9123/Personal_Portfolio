            Hi, I'm <strong>Arijit Paul</strong>, a final-year Computer Science & Engineering student with a passion for software development, web technologies, and problem-solving. Over the past few years, I have gained hands-on experience in programming, building projects, and exploring various technologies. I enjoy working on innovative solutions, optimizing code, and learning new tools that enhance efficiency and user experience. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic and challenging environment. Beyond coding, I love participating in hackathons, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest tech trends.
